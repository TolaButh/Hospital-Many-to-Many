        <h3>What Does a Hospital Manager Do?</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Job growth for medical and health services managers outpaces all other industries (32 percent growth vs. 7 percent), and the demand will only increase.1

Knowing what a typical day or week is like helps open one’s eyes to everything involved in a healthcare facility’s managerial role.</p>
        <h3>Hospital Manager: A Career Profile</h3>
        <p>Driven by a passion for serving others, healthcare professionals have found a rewarding field. In a recent PayScale survey that compared median pay, job meaning, and satisfaction for 454 different occupations, 74 percent of healthcare practitioners and technicians expressed “high satisfaction.” 2

            After several years in this profession, many healthcare professionals decide to take their careers to the next level as hospital managers. Hospital managers have at least a bachelor’s degree, but many employers increasingly prefer a master’s degree.
            
            Taking business administration and healthcare management courses is a good way to enter the field of healthcare management. Still, an MBA degree with a healthcare management specialization can accelerate advancement to higher levels. </p>
        
        <h3>A Day in the Life of a Hospital Manager</h3>
        <p>Hospital administrators may not hold a scalpel, but they play a critical role in keeping hospitals on the cutting edge of medicine and healthcare delivery. A good hospital administrator is the heart of a hospital, responsible for maintaining all the major functions that make it successful, including facilities and staff management, budgeting, operations, and compliance. It’sIt’s a role that demands an intimate understanding of both the business and healthcare worlds. Every day, they operate with one goal in mind: to keep all the different parts running smoothly, effectively, and cohesively to create a well-oiled center for exceptional patient care.

            One of the most exciting aspects of this high-level management position is that no two days are alike. In eight business hours, a hospital administrator is likely to apply several different skillsets to various tasks. They might begin their day in their private office reviewing the most recent financial reports and managed care contracts before heading to a board meeting regarding hiring the hospital’s new chief of surgery. As a critical stakeholder in a hospital’s decision-making process, hospital administrators collaborate closely with cross-functional team leads. They must be able to effectively communicate with individuals at every level, from doctors, nurses, and patients, to fellow administrators, board members, and vendors. Lunch, for example, might double as a business meeting with different department heads to discuss the hospital’s strategy for streamlining operations while cutting costs. Depending on the hospital’s size and goals, a hospital administrator may help develop new scientific research programs.
